CS244 ’17: An Argument For Increasing TCP’S Initial Congestion Window

Set up an instance on Google cloud with the following configuration:
```
n1-standard-1 (1 vCPU, 3.75 GB memory)
Ubuntu 17.04 (GNU/Linux 4.10.0-19-generic x86_64)
```

## Running the experiment
```
git clone ...
cd ..
sudo ./run.sh
```

The resulting figures will be output to the results directory. Using the standard instance it should take approximately an hour to run. If you encounter any issues please contact me.
